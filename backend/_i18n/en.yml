We can remove a piece of the thin cuticle of the leaf for this, but for some plants, it is not so successful, for example, due to the stiffness of the leaf. However, this can be compensated by using the same method as the researchers at Plantentuin Meise, namely, taking an impression of a part of the leaf surface with transparent nail polish. The microscopic image can be photographed with a smartphone."

              file_info: "In this activity, students learn how data transfer over the Internet works. Computers, smartphones, and other devices connected via the Internet can communicate with each other. To understand each other, this communication must follow certain agreements. We call these agreements a protocol."

              file_info: "To send images over networks, we want to represent information with as little data as possible. Compression comes into play here. Using algorithms, images are represented with as few numbers as possible, but in a way that you can still recover the original figure. Other algorithms restore the original image when the information reaches its destination."

Your intelligent mind is trapped in a useless body: you can feel everything but cannot communicate. It can happen to anyone, out of nowhere, as a result of a stroke. If you wanted to help people with locked-in syndrome, would you be better off as a doctor or nurse? Or can you help as a computer scientist?"
